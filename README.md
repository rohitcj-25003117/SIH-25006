# **Problem Title**

**SIH 25006: Creation of a Smart Biosecure Farm Management System for Pig and Poultry Sectors**

---

# **Problem Description**

## **Background**

Pig and poultry farms in India face recurring threats from infectious diseases such as Classical Swine Fever, Avian Flu, and other rapidly spreading pathogens. These outbreaks not only affect farm income but also disrupt national food supply chains. Although government departments issue guidelines, farmers struggle with:

* Lack of real-time risk awareness
* Inadequate record-keeping
* No central platform to track compliance
* Delayed outbreak alerts
* Absence of farm-specific disease risk estimation

Traditional methods are manual and slow, making it difficult for farmers and authorities to maintain consistent biosecurity standards across multiple regions.

---

## **Problem Description**

To overcome these challenges, the project aims to develop a **Digital Biosecure Farm Management System** that digitizes farm operations and helps farmers adopt strong biosecurity practices.

The system should include:

* **Automated farm vulnerability assessment** based on routines, hygiene, and location-based risks
* **Interactive learning modules** that simplify complex biosecurity principles
* **Compliance monitoring dashboard** linked to government guidelines
* **Early-warning alerts** for disease outbreaks and biosecurity violations
* **Centralized data portal** for authorities to study trends and issue timely guidelines
* **Support for multiple local languages**
* **Mobile-friendly interface** to reach farmers with limited digital access

The system must function as a powerful digital assistant that enhances on-ground disease prevention efforts.

---

# **Expected Outcomes**

* Stronger knowledge of biosecurity among farmers
* Accurate self-assessment tools for disease prevention
* Digital logs that help farmers maintain records effortlessly
* Faster response to outbreaks through alerts
* Better animal health, resulting in higher productivity
* Support to government agencies with reliable field-level data
* Improved preparedness for future livestock emergencies
* Strengthened coordination between farmers, veterinary officers, and field staff

# **Proposed Solution**

## **Detailed Explanation**

The solution is a **Smart Biosecurity Management Platform** with a modern, modular design:

### **1. Biosecurity Rating Engine**

* Uses a rule-based scoring model
* Evaluates farm practices such as feed storage, waste management, visitor entry, farm cleaning, livestock movement, etc.
* Generates a “Biosecurity Status Card” with priority actions

### **2. Knowledge & Training Hub**

* Simple, farmer-friendly video guides
* Step-by-step checklists
* Animated instructions for disease prevention
* Micro-learning modules that farmers can complete in short sessions

### **3. Compliance Calendar**

* Daily, weekly, and monthly tasks
* Automatic reminders for cleaning, vaccination, disinfection, etc.

### **4. Incident & Alert System**

* Region-wise disease notifications
* SOS reporting feature for farmers to alert vets
* Weather-based disease risk indicators

### **5. Multi-Stakeholder Dashboard**

* Veterinarians can track multiple farms
* Authorities can see biosecurity compliance trends
* Farmers can view suggestions and farm health reports

### **6. Multilingual, Accessible Interface**

* Voice-assisted navigation
* Offline-first functionality
* Low-data mode for weak network areas

### **7. Data Insights & Policy Support**

* Trends in disease spread
* Region-wise compliance levels
* Data-backed recommendations helping policymaking

---

## **How the Solution Addresses the Problem**

* Converts complex biosecurity standards into easy digital tasks
* Provides continuous monitoring instead of one-time inspections
* Trains farmers through accessible content
* Gives instant alerts to reduce outbreak impact
* Improves transparency between farmers and authorities
* Enables better decision-making using real-time data analytics

---

## **Innovation and Uniqueness**

* **AI-enhanced biosecurity scoring** using farm activity patterns
* **Geo-fencing of farms** for region-specific disease warnings
* **Gamified learning**, awarding badges for completed modules
* **Offline-first mode** for rural connectivity
* **Voice guidance** for farmers who struggle with reading
* **Automatic compliance calendar**, unique to each farm type

This provides a modern, practical, farmer-first approach.

* Redis for caching alerts and notifications

### **Cloud & Hosting**

* AWS EC2 / Lambda for backend
* S3 for media content storage
* Firebase Cloud Messaging for push alerts

### **AI & Analytics**

* Python-based models for risk scoring and outbreak prediction
* GIS tools for mapping biosecurity hotspots

### **Development Methodology**

1. Requirement gathering & field studies
2. UI/UX prototyping and farmer usability testing
3. Development of risk scoring and compliance modules
4. Integration of alert engine and multilingual interface
5. GIS mapping and analytics integration
6. Pilot testing with actual farms
7. Deployment + refinement based on feedback

# **Feasibility and Viability**

### **Technical Feasibility**

* All technologies are mature and widely used
* Easily scalable to multiple states
* Mobile-first design ensures wide adoption

### **Potential Challenges**

* Farmers may not be familiar with digital platforms
* Network issues in interior rural regions
* Hesitation to share data

### **Strategies to Overcome Challenges**

* Voice-guided usage tutorials inside the app
* Local data storage + sync when internet is available
* Strong security (AES encryption, role-based access)

---

# **Impact and Benefits**

### **Impact**

* Lower disease outbreaks in poultry and pig farms
* Data-based surveillance for government departments
* Higher productivity, lower mortality
* Economic stability for small farmers

### **Benefits**

* **Social**: Better awareness, strong collaboration
* **Economic**: Prevents economic losses caused by diseases
* **Environmental**: Better waste handling, reduced chemical overuse
